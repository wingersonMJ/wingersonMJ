# Hi, I'm Mathew! ðŸ‘‹
## About me...
**Name:** Mathew Wingerson (he/him)\
**Location:** Denver, CO (relocating to... tbd)\
**Job:** PhD Student in Rehabilitation Science with focus in Data Sciences and Health Analytics\
**Company:** University of Colorado School of Medicine | [Colorado Concussion Research Laboratory](https://medschool.cuanschutz.edu/orthopedics/research/labs/howell-concussion-lab)
<br><br>

## **Education:**
**Doctor of Philosophy (expected 2026)** | University of Colorado School of Medicine
> Program:
>> Rehabilitation Sciences (study of disease progresion/treatment)

> Research focus:
>> Statistics, Data Sciences, and Health Analytics to improve diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of medically complex injuries.\
>> Forecasting symptom progression using post-concussion clinical data.


**Concentration/Certification in Data Science and Health Analytics (expected 2025)** | University of Colorado School of Medicine
> Research focus:
>> Modeling of complex real-world data to generate actionable insights for improving concussion recovery.\
>> Machine learning, deep learning, and various data science topics:
>>> Multi-layer perceptron networks (feed forward)\
>>> Convolutional networks\
>>> Recurrent neural networks

<br><br>
## Motivation...
I'm passionate about using data to generate predictions and drive decision-making! I have a strong foundation in applied mathematics, including modern machine learning and deep learning architectures, and I enjoy using that knowledge to solve real-world problems.  
<br>
I thrive when allowed to leverage conventional statistics, machine learning, and deep learning to make sense out of imperfect data. I am looking for a career that allows me to use these tools to tackle increasingly complex problems in fields where simple solutions fall short! 

<br><br>
## What I am learning now...
**Multi-layer perceptrons**
> Predicting cancer development from omics data.\
> Predicting non-resolving mental health symptoms in adolescents with concussion.

**Convolutional networks**
> Identifying lession types from medical imaging.\
> Predicting age from facial features.

**Recurrent networks**
> Predicting symptom progression using wearable physical activity and sleep data during concussion recovery.\
> Scenario testing to generate exercise recomendations for patients with concussion.

**Generative models**
> Projects tbd...

<br><br>
## Projects I've worked on...
**Near-infrared spectroscopy for identifying cerebrovascualr impairment in adolescents with concussion**
> Quantifying cerebrovascular dysfunction using advanced medical technology.

**Isotemportal substituion modeling of wearable activity tracking**
> Time-based (i.e., temporal) modeling of activity behaviors and their effect on post-concussion symptom resolution.

**Structural equation modeling of longitudinal data**
> Sleep and exercise: Longitudinal assocations throughout recovery from concussion.

**Longitudinal analysis of Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy**
> Neurometabolite concentrations predict physical activity volumes after concussion.

**Random forests**
> Predicting non-resolving mental health disturbance after concussion using diverse clinical data.

**Propensity score-based randomization**
> Using propensity-score metrics to randomize serum/plasma samples during analysis.
>> Purpose: Balance relevant covariates between batches without cross-plate controls
