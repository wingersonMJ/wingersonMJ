## Motivation...
I have a passion for identifying patterns in data and for using those patterns to make predictions and guide clinical management for medically complex injuries! I have a strong foundation in applied mathematics, including modern machine learning and deep learning architectures, and I enjoy using that knowledge to solve real-world problems.  
<br>
I thrive when allowed to leverage conventional statistics, machine learning, and deep learning to make sense out of imperfect data. I am looking for a career that allows me to use these tools to tackle increasingly complex problems in fields where simple solutions fall short! 

<br><br>
## What I am learning now...
**Multi-layer perceptrons**
> Predicting cancer development from omics data.  
> Early identification of non-resolving mental health symptoms in adolescents with concussion.  
> Differentiation of idiopathic from neuromuscular scoliosis in pediatric populations.  
> Patterns of post-concussion sleep and physical activity that influence recovery time.  
> Fun neural net example  [[link to project repo](https://github.com/wingersonMJ/Neural_net_example)]   

**Convolutional networks**
> Identifying lession types from medical imaging.  
> Predicting age from facial features.  

**Recurrent networks**
> Predicting symptom progression using wearable physical activity and sleep data during concussion recovery.  
> Scenario testing to generate exercise recommendations for patients with concussion.  

**Generative models**
> Real-time personalized sleep and exercise recommendations after concussion using wearable data.  

<br><br>
## Projects I've worked on...
**Near-infrared spectroscopy for identifying cerebrovascular impairment in adolescents with concussion**
> Quantifying cerebrovascular dysfunction using Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS).  

**Isotemportal substitution modeling of wearable activity tracking**
> Time-based (i.e., temporal) modeling of activity behaviors and their effect on post-concussion symptom resolution.  

**Structural equation modeling of longitudinal data**
> Sleep and exercise: Longitudinal associations throughout recovery from concussion. 

**Longitudinal analysis of Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy**
> Neurometabolite concentrations predict physical activity volumes after concussion. [[link to project repo](https://github.com/wingersonMJ/MRSpect_analysis)]  

**Random forests**
> Predicting non-resolving mental health disturbance after concussion using diverse clinical data.  

**Propensity score-based randomization**
> Using propensity-score metrics to randomize serum/plasma samples during analysis.  [[link to project repo](https://github.com/wingersonMJ/batch_randomization)]  

**Other projects with tabular data**
> Predicting exercise test performance in adolescents with concussion [[link to project repo](https://github.com/wingersonMJ/Exercise_test_HRm)]  
> Factors influencing return to sport progressions in the months after sport-related brain injury [[link to project repo](https://github.com/wingersonMJ/Whalen_RTS)]  
> Time-to-event analysis [[link to project repo](https://github.com/wingersonMJ/Salfi_fourGroups)]
